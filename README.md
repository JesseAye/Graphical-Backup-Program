# Graphical-Backup-Program

Graphical Backup Program (GBP) is a significantly improved version of [Folder Copy](https://github.com/ellman12/Folder-Copy). It worked good as a proof-of-concept, but making it a command line tool wasn't the smartest idea, and Python was not a good choice to use for the language. It had some other issues as well, including not being able to back up files (just folders).

The purpose of this program, just like FC, is to help me automatically back up my "super important" folders to an external location like the cloud (in addition to a full PC backup). Things like video game save files, code, etc. I like to have extra backups of super important stuff like this. It is also nice if I need these files on another PC, I can grab them from the cloud easily. So instead of having to go hunting for all of those folders and files every time I want to back them up, I just use this.

Some nice features of GBP (compared to FC) are:
* Easy-to-use GUI
* Ability to backup files in addition to folders
* Easily switch between where backups are created
* Create multiple GBP backups
* Clear backups folder before backing up to prevent extra, unnecessary backups from consuming disk space
* Ability to save time by only backing up common items that frequently change
