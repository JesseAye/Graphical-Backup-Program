v2.0 completely revamps and overhauls a lot of GBP

• Redesigned GUI. Should hopefully be a bit better/more logical than the original
	Added StatusStrip with a label with useful info and a progress bar

TODO:
implement some GUI logic for status label

• Changed from common and uncommon paths to "groups". Now instead of specifying 'c' or 'u', you specify a number 0-9. You can then check which ones you want backed up. There is also the ability to label what each group is.
• Removed GroupBox that toggles the creation of a timestamp folder because I have no idea why you wouldn't want that.
• Add a feature to automatically open a URL like to Google Drive when a backup finishes.

Try WaitCursor and explore other properties
Log should output to a file now. Open in either Notepad or a Form or something on completion
