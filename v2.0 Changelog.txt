v2.0 completely revamps and overhauls a lot of GBP

TODO:
• Changed from common and uncommon paths to "groups". Now instead of specifying 'c' or 'u', you specify a number 0-9. You can then check which ones you want backed up. There is also the ability to label what each group is.
• Removed GroupBox that toggles the creation of a timestamp folder because I have no idea why you wouldn't want that.
